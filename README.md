# Xerzy's Fancy Code Environment Thingie™®©

Heya there! Welcome to my cozy, comfy dev repo. This is *basically* what I use
to pretend I'm on a regular Linux doing regular Linux things. I made this after
getting a bit too used to Racket, then realizing Magic Racket wouldn't work on
my prior VSCodium-on-Flatpak setup.

I *might* end up making a simplified template eventually, a la `nixos-systems`,
but for now I hope this is readable and useful enough as-is. Thanks for passing
by!
